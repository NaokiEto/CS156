1.c

average is 0.371 heads out of 10 flips.

2. d

for crand, epsilon = 0.0017

for cfirst, epsilon = 0.0025

for cmin, epsilon = 0.0371 -->P(|v-u| > 0.4627) <= 0.0276

because N = 10, epsilon has to be at least 0.186 . Only the cmin fits this criteria

test epsilon = 0.3 for cmin

get the minimum of the 1000 coin flip scenarios, see if it is 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, or 10 heads
